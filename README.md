## Introduction

The **Stock Price Analysis and Prediction with AI** project is designed for anyone interested in leveraging AI to understand stock market trends and make data-driven investment decisions. It integrates historical data analysis, machine learning predictions, and insights generated by a natural language processing model. The tool is highly customizable and can be adapted for various stocks, durations, and advanced use cases.

## Features

- **Data Collection**:
  - Fetches historical stock price data for any ticker symbol using the `yfinance` library.

- **Data Processing**:
  - Computes financial metrics such as moving averages, daily returns, and percentage changes.

- **Predictive Modeling**:
  - Uses a trained machine learning model to predict the next trading day's stock price.

- **Actionable Recommendations**:
  - Offers "Buy", "Sell", or "Hold" advice based on the predicted vs. current stock price.

- **LLM-Driven Insights**:
  - Leverages a Hugging Face language model to generate human-readable investment analysis and summaries.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python 3.8 or higher installed.

### Steps

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yash-dave/stock-analysis-predictor.git
    cd stock-analysis-predictor
    ```

2. Install required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Create the `models` directory if it doesn't exist:
    ```bash
    mkdir models
    ```

---

## Usage

1. Run the main script:
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

2. Enter the required details when prompted:
   - **Stock Ticker**: For example, `AAPL` for Apple, `GOOGL` for Alphabet.
   - **Duration**: Specify the number of years of historical data to analyze.

3. View the outputs:
   - Predicted stock price for the next trading day.
   - Recommendations: **Buy**, **Sell**, or **Hold**.
   - A summary of historical stock performance and investment insights.

---

## Detailed Workflow

1. **Fetch Data**: Retrieve historical stock prices for the specified ticker and duration.
2. **Process Data**: Compute key metrics like moving averages and daily returns.
3. **Train or Load Model**: Train a Random Forest model (or load an existing one) to predict future stock prices.
4. **Generate Prediction**: Predict the next day's stock price using the trained model.
5. **Provide Recommendations**: Compare the predicted price to the current price and suggest investment actions.
6. **LLM Insights**: Summarize the stockâ€™s performance using a pre-trained language model.

## Future Enhancements

- **Advanced Prediction Models**:
  - Implement deep learning models such as LSTMs or GRUs for more accurate time-series analysis.
  
- **Additional Data Integration**:
  - Include trading volumes, news sentiment analysis, or macroeconomic indicators.

- **Real-Time Features**:
  - Enable real-time stock price predictions with live market data.

- **Interactive Dashboard**:
  - Develop a web-based or GUI-based interface for enhanced user experience.
